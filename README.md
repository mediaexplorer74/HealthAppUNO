"Design/Code pattern": Multiplatform Health app Sample in Uno Platform

This sample shows a concept of a Health app running on Windows 10, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Android & WebAssembly using [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/) (see also on [GitHub](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/)). 

Inspired by [Jordan Singer](https://twitter.com/jsngr?s=20).

Also I used [Martin Zikmund](https://github.com/MartinZikmund/uno-health-app-concept/)'s Uno Health app "design pattern / code template".
