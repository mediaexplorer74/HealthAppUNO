"Design/Code pattern": Multiplatform Health app Sample in Uno Platform

This sample shows a concept of a Health app running on Windows 10, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Android & WebAssembly using [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/) (see also on [GitHub](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/)). 

Inspired by [Jordan Singer](https://twitter.com/jsngr?s=20).

I used [Martin Zikmund 's Uno Health app "design pattern / code template"](https://github.com/MartinZikmund/uno-health-app-concept/) for my RnD.

## Status

- Demaged. If I change (at UWP project) min. os. build to 16299, all seems to be ok.
- But for 15063 I catch “all systems mulfunction” ^ ^
- Perhaps, Uno.Core and Uno.UI not liked Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls … idk, really :(
